# ME231a-MPC-Rocket-Landing
In this paper, we discuss the design and simulation about landing of a rocket on a moving platform using Model Predictive Control (MPC) in 2D. For simulation and MPC, we will be using the non-linear rocket model with the MPC being the closed-loop trajectory of the landing.
